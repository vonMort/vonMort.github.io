      "Do you prefer to deal steady damage over time?",
      "Would you rather land smaller reliable hits than gamble on a few big ones?",
      "Does it really bother you when a missed shot leaves you useless for a long time?",

      "Are you fine with your success depending heavily on luck?",

      "Is it fine if you are unnoticed as long as you stay effective?",
      "Do you prefer a visible, heavy role over a subtle one?",

    "E. Flexibility & Adaptation": [
      "Do you like being able to switch flanks even mid-battle?",
      "Would you be content running almost the same game plan every time?",
      "Do you love improvising when the battle gets chaotic?",

      "Do you enjoy adapting to changing situations even if it is hard?",
      "Is it more important to you to be extremely strong in a clear niche rather than just ok everywhere?",
      "Would you prefer a tank that works well solo regardless of team?",
      "Would you be satisfied doing little alone if you are indispensable with a team?"
